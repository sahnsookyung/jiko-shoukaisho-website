One's ideals are a representation of at least some of those meanings, and living could be considered as an attempt to find and coexist alongside the vectors that align with one's ideals, in this universe that we were born into. Whether this be finding a profession, or other minds, geolocations, or experiences.</p>"

            "content": "<p>We all want to make good decisions. To do this effectively, we need to understand our current situation and the options available to us. Ideally, we'd have complete information about our present state, all possible future states, and the expected outcomes of every action we could take. In reality, this is impossible. The best we can do is make optimal decisions based on what we know right now—or can we?</p><p>Several key factors complicate decision-making:</p><ul><li>Our cognitive resources are limited, preventing us from evaluating every possible option</li><li>Our assumptions about costs and benefits may be wrong</li><li>The world is inherently multivariate and stochastic, making true expected values unknowable</li><li>We change as we experience life, unconsciously adjusting our weights and biases for future options</li><li>Some decisions are reversible while others permanently close off certain paths</li></ul><p>Given these constraints, should we simply optimize for the best immediate decision? While this greedy approach can work, it's not always ideal. Consider <strong>Dijkstra's algorithm</strong> in computer science. It efficiently finds the shortest path when all connections are positive, but fails when negative edges exist. We sometimes need to backtrack on decisions, accepting short-term setbacks to find better long-term paths.</p><p>In these cases, the <strong>Bellman-Ford algorithm</strong> is a more accurate metaphor, but this flexibility comes at a cost: it is significantly less efficient and requires more resources (time and energy) to process than a simple greedy approach.</p><p>A more effective approach resembles the <strong>A* algorithm</strong>: when you know your core values, you can navigate life more efficiently by assigning appropriate weights to your choices. This requires self-awareness about what truly matters to you.</p><p>To make better decisions, we must cultivate the courage to cut our losses without falling prey to the sunk-cost fallacy. Stay knowledgeable to stay aware of the available possibilities, exercise intellectual honesty to update our beliefs when evidence contradicts them, and avoid self-deception even when the truth is uncomfortable.</p>"

            "content": "<p>I have had the privilege of exploring the world, encountering countless beautiful landscapes and people along the way. This is not to say that there were no negative experiences, but certainly, the utility of exploring the world far surpasses them. The importance of adventure, exploration, and discovery cannot be stressed enough, both from a utilitarian and a psychological perspective.</p><p>For the utilitarian, exploration provided a firsthand way to research and test beliefs when deciding on countries for future relocation. It forced me to exist in a state of constant decision-making, honing the ability to handle unexpected real-time situations and perform cost-benefit analyses on what to do and where to go next.</p><p>From a human perspective, it was liberating to set off alone. It offered the chance to be free of the social contracts found in familiarity, to discover suppressed aspects of the self, and to try on new facades in low-risk situations to see if they fit. It was an opportunity to launch oneself deep into nature—trekking through fjords, mountains, jungles, volcanoes, snowstorms, dunes, and the depths of the ocean; to sled the North in the blue hour, skydive surrounded by the highest peaks in Europe's snowy mountaintops, or bungee the highest bridge in Africa; and to marvel at the aurora borealis, meteor showers, and the glistening gold of sunsets on snow. These experiences taught me what makes the heart rejoice and revealed the vast array of wonders available for the human mind to enjoy.</p>"
