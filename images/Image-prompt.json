    "nano_banana_prompt": "Wide horizontal scroll painting. A smooth Sumi-e ink wash painting with heavy black brushstrokes. A Korean scholar wearing a white traditional \"Hahoe\" mask with visible wood grain (very slight smile, closed mouth) and black Gat hat sits in a mountain pavilion. On the desk: a laptop made of dark driftwood and a tightly rolled, closed scroll. The scroll has mysterious markings indicative of time. The landscape features Icelandic volcanic peaks, jagged black rocks, and misty fjords, and European gothic style cities, as well as Japanese temples. A torii gate lines one of the ridges. An old philosopher statue is on the way to the torii gate. Above, a sketch-like Da Vinci machine glides and a man can be seen dropping from the vehicle. Texture: Faded silk, mineral pigments, eerie and atmospheric. --ar 16:9",
